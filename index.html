    <p> Welcome to my portfolio website. As you can see, there's nothing here right now. That's because this is a project in and of itself, and more will come with time. I've been dabbling in website building and coding for many years, but never had a properly finished project or set up a portfolio. This is going to be my way of committing to my projects now so that I can become a better programmer and hopefully be able to start a career in the industry. I will try to update these pages as often as possible.
